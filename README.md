# Oriented matroid Grassmannians or MacPhersonians

These are the programs that support Chapter 6 of my PhD thesis titled "Grassmannians, measure partitions and waists of spheres".

The folder "Creating all oriented matroids" supports Chapter 6.3 of the thesis and it contains the code that creates all oriented matroids for a given rank and the number of elements. In addition, the lists of all oriented matroids of rank 3 on 6 and 7 elements are given (sorted by the number of bases). Some of the files are split into a few parts, because of their size.

The folder "Finding fixed points" supports Chapter 6.4 of the thesis. It contains the code that gives all fixed oriented matroids under the action of a certain group, and it also contains the output of that code.
