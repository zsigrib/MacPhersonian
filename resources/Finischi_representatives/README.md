# `Finschi_R_N.txt`

The file `Finschi_R_N.txt` contains a list, with exactly one representative of each isomorphism class of oriented matroids of rank `R` on `N` elements. Two oriented matroids are considered isomorphic if one can be obtained from the other by permuting its elements and/or flipping the sign of some of the elements. Each oriented matroid is represented by a chirotope.

Each column corresponds to a given ordered `R`-tuple of elements in `{1,...,N}` (the digits in the first `R` rows specify this tuple), and each row to a chirotope: the sign written in the row corresponding to $\chi$ and column corresponding to `R`-tuple $(a_1,\ldots,a_R)$ contains the value $\chi(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$.

**Note:** these files are first reformatted, before we use them.

**Note:** The above website contains lists of isomorphism classes of _possibly non-uniform_ oriented matroids as well, but those lists only contain simple representatives (ones without parallel elements or loops).
